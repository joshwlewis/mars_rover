MARS ROVER
==========

This is my solution to the [Mars Rover Project](http://thefundoowriter.wordpress.com/2009/10/01/the-mars-rover-problem/) with the following modification:

NASA has decided to shorten movement command strings by allowing input to contain quantity modifiers.  For example:

Input: 
4 6 
1 1 N 
M4LMLM3R7 

Output: 
0 2 E

Just run ruby rove.rb to see it go!
